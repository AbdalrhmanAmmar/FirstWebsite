                            <p class="text-cenyer"><span>Who Was Carl Sagan?</span>
                                Astronomer Carl Sagan graduated from the University of Chicago, where he studied planets
                                and explored theories of extraterrestrial intelligence. He was named director of
                                Cornell’s Laboratory for Planetary Studies in 1968 and worked with NASA on several
                                projects. An anti-nuclear activist, Sagan introduced the idea of “nuclear winter” in
                                1983. He wrote one novel, several books and academic papers and the TV series Cosmos,
                                which was reborn on TV in 2014.

                                Early Years
                                Carl Edward Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York, the first of two
                                children. Sagan’s interest in astronomy began early on, and when he was five, his mother
                                sent him to the library to find books on the stars. Soon after, his parents took him to
                                the New York World’s Fair, where visions of the future piqued his interest further. He
                                also quickly became a fan of the prevalent 1940s science-fiction stories in pulp
                                magazines and was drawn in by reports of flying saucers that suggested extraterrestrial
                                life.

                                Sagan graduated high school in 1951 at age 16 and headed to the University of Chicago,
                                where experiments he conducted drove his fascination with the possibility of alien life.
                                In 1955, Sagan graduated with a B.A. in physics, and he received his masters a year
                                later. Four years later, Sagan moved to California after obtaining a Ph.D. in astronomy
                                and astrophysics, landing at the University of California, Berkeley, as a fellow in
                                astronomy. There, he helped a team develop an infrared radiometer for NASA’s Mariner 2
                                robotic probe.</p>

                            <p class="text-cenyer"><span>Who Was Richard Feynman?</span>
                                Feynman remade quantum electrodynamics—the theory of the interaction between light and
                                matter—and thus altered the way science understands the nature of waves and particles.
                                He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for this work, which tied together
                                in an experimentally perfect package all the varied phenomena at work in light, radio,
                                electricity, and magnetism. The other cowinners of the Nobel Prize, Julian S. Schwinger
                                of the United States and Tomonaga Shin’ichirō of Japan, had independently created
                                equivalent theories, but it was Feynman’s that proved the most original and
                                far-reaching. The problem-solving tools that he invented—including pictorial
                                representations of particle interactions known as Feynman diagrams—permeated many areas
                                of theoretical physics in the second half of the 20th century.

                                Born in the Far Rockaway section of New York City, Feynman was the descendant of Russian
                                and Polish Jews who had immigrated to the United States late in the 19th century. He
                                studied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his undergraduate
                                thesis (1939) proposed an original and enduring approach to calculating forces in
                                molecules. Feynman received his doctorate at Princeton University in 1942. At Princeton,
                                with his adviser, John Archibald Wheeler, he developed an approach to quantum mechanics
                                governed by the principle of least action. This approach replaced the wave-oriented
                                electromagnetic picture developed by James Clerk Maxwell with one based entirely on
                                particle interactions mapped in space and time. In effect, Feynman’s method calculated
                                the probabilities of all the possible paths a particle could take in going from one
                                point to another.</p>

                                Charles Robert Darwin was a British naturalist and biologist known for his theory of
                                evolution and his understanding of the process of natural selection. In 1831, he
                                embarked on a five-year voyage around the world on the HMS Beagle, during which time his
                                studies of various plants and an led him to formulate his theories. In 1859, he
                                published his landmark book, On the Origin of Species.

                                Early Life
                                Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, in the tiny merchant town of Shrewsbury, England.
                                A child of wealth and privilege who loved to explore nature, Darwin was the second
                                youngest of six kids.

                                Darwin came from a long line of scientists: His father, Dr. R.W. Darwin, was a medical
                                doctor, and his grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, was a renowned botanist. Darwin’s
                                mother, Susanna, died when he was only eight years old.

                                Education
                                In October 1825, at age 16, Darwin enrolled at University of Edinburgh along with his
                                brother Erasmus. Two years later, he became a student at Christ's College in Cambridge.

                                His father hoped he would follow in his footsteps and become a medical doctor, but the
                                sight of blood made Darwin queasy. His father suggested he study to become a parson
                                instead, but Darwin was far more inclined to study natural history.</p>

                                Sam Harris is the author of five New York Times best sellers. His books include The End
                                of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking
                                Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the
                                2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of
                                topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence,
                                rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the
                                world is changing our sense of how we should live.

                                Sam’s work has been published in more than 20 languages and has been discussed in The
                                New York Times, Time, Scientific American, Nature, Rolling Stone, and many other
                                publications. He has written for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The
                                Economist, The Times (London), The Boston Globe, The Atlantic, Nature, Proceedings of
                                the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), The Annals of Neurology, among others. He also
                                hosts the Making Sense Podcast, which was selected by Apple as one of the “iTunes Best”
                                and has won a Webby Award for best podcast in the Science & Education category.

                                Sam received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience
                                from UCLA. He has also practiced meditation for more than 30 years and has studied with
                                many Tibetan, Indian, Burmese, and Western meditation teachers, both in the United
                                States and abroad. Sam has created the Waking Up app for anyone who wants to learn to
                                meditate in a modern, scientific context.</p>
